# sim.management
Simulation of a stage-structured, seasonal, American mink-like population managed usign a variety of control strategies that differ in their allocation of trapping effort in response to season and pervieced populaiton density. Analysis and creation of figures follows simulaiton.

The file "stage structured invasive management.R" runs all simulation and analysis, and calls the other three files in this repository.

RUNGUIDE:
- Download all 4 .R files. 
- Give the object "this.wd" within "stage structured invasive management.R" a text string stipulating the workign directory within which the code files are saved 
- run "stage structured invasive management.R"
